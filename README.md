# docker-apache
Docker is a pre requisite for testing. 

1. folder local-apache contains an images directory and index.html
for the background image of the web page and index.html for the 
webpage its self . 
2. setup.sh is a basic shell script that you can run that will check
your system for docker and let you know what you need to do if you do not have it. 
3. Dockerfile controls the build out of the Docker container if you want to modify
the web page. 

### Please note, this is just an example of a test you can use to play with html via
### apache if you do not have it installed or do not want to take the time to set apache 
### Please run "git clone https://github.com/tcooksd/docker-apache.git" to pull this repo.
